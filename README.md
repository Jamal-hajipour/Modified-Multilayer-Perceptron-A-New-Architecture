# Modified-Multilayer-Perceptron-A-New-Architecture
These are the codes written for the paper "Modified Multilayer Perceptron: A New Architecture" which you can download it from arXiv.
The Iris flower classification code is based on V√çTOR GAMA LEMOS code "Multilayer Perceptron from scratch"
https://www.kaggle.com/code/vitorgamalemos/multilayer-perceptron-from-scratch?scriptVersionId=79241565
which we modify it for our new architecture. You can also visit link below for more information about Lemos code:

The MNIST classification Code is based on Charanjeet Singh code "Digit_recognition_numpy"
https://github.com/charan89/Digit_recognition_numpy.git
which we modify it for our new architecture. Please visit link above for more information about Singh code.
